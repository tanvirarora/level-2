# Shopping Cart Simulation
* 2,Owned,Regular Carts,F,jep,sesmith5,false
- [Backlog] Regular carts always choose the shortest line excluding the express register line (at index 0). If there are multiple shortest lines, a regular cart chooses one with the smallest index.
- [Owned] Adding to sesmith5 backlog.
* 5,Verifying,Calculating Wait Time,B,jdyoung2,sesmith5,false
- [Backlog] Special carts are failing system tests associated with wait time.
- [Owned] Adding to sesmith5 backlog.
- [Processing] Replicated failure locally in unit test.
- [Verifying] Implementation complete. Requires peer inspection.
* 3,Processing,Java Swing,KA,sesmith5,sesmith5,false
- [Backlog] Learn more about Swing to debug GUI.
- [Owned] Adding to sesmith5 backlog.
- [Processing] Found Swing tutorials at http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/start/.
* 1,Backlog,Express Carts,F,jep,unowned,false
- [Backlog] Express carts always choose the shortest line. If there are multiple shortest lines, an express cart chooses the one with the smallest index.
* 10,Rejected,Flatbed carts,F,jep,unowned,false
- [Backlog] Add flatbed carts to simulation.
- [Owned] Rejected. Flatbed carts won't fit through physical register stations.
* 5,Backlog,Ignored,F,sesmith5,unowned,false
- [Backlog] This task should be ignored due to a duplicate id number
* 8,Done,Special Carts,F,jep,sesmith5,true
- [Backlog] Special carts always choose the shortest special register line.
If there are multiple shortest special register lines, a special cart
chooses one with the smallest index.
- [Owned] Adding to sesmith5 backlog.
- [Processing] Created hierarchy to prepare for other cart types.
- [Verifying] Implementation complete. Requires peer inspection.
- [Done] No problems found during inspection.
