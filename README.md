# level-2 (2021)

This is an example project that was completed a quarter of the way through my CSC 216 - Sofware Development Fundamentals class last year. Some of the code that was given includes the GUI and interfaces. 

Other projects were completed within groups that involved implementing custom array and linked lists, stacks and queues, iterators, and recursive algorithms. Due to those projects being completed in groups, I can not share them over github but can display them over a call.

I am have taken a data structures and algorithms course where we have implemented different structures such as trees, maps, sets, graphs, lists, stacks, queues, etc. I can not have it on github but I can show it over a call.

Currently, I am working on full stack project with a group in CSC 326 - Software Engineering course. We are following AGILE development methodoligies as well as working with tools such as Spring, MySql, Hibernate, Angular, Java, Github, REST API's, etc. I can display this project over a call but can not publish the existing code base here.
