# level-2

This is an example project that was completed a quarter of the way through my CSC 216 class last year. Some of the code that was given includes the GUI and interfaces. 

Other projects were completed within groups that involved implementing custom array and linked lists, stacks and queues, iterators, and recursive algorithms. Due to those projects being completed in groups, I can not share them over github but can display them over a call.
